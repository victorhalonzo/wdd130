          Hello, I am Victor Alonzo from Portoviejo, Ecuador. I enjoy to play
          the piano, spend time with friens, ride bicycle and to watch football.
          I work as a software programmer and as a college professor. I am the
          secretary of my ward and sometimes I play the piano in the sacrament
          meetings. I served a mission in Bolivia and I enjoyed very much that
          experience. I have one brother. I enjoy building software solutions
          for people and companies. I have led software projects for
          international companies. These projects have ranged from inventory
          management to budget control. I have good skills in solving software
          problems and designing user interfaces. I am now ready to take my
          skills and love of programming to the next level. Also I am preparing
          to be a university professor through a teaching course. My favorite
          football team is Emelec.
